### 1. Create Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select `bangkok-fortune-voice-ai`

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add all variables from `.env.sample`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=...
OWNER_ALERT_PHONE=...

# Or use Railway CLI
railway up
```

### 4. Note Your Service URL

After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
```

```

You'll need this for Twilio configuration.

---

## ‚òéÔ∏è Twilio Configuration

### 1. Get Your Twilio Phone Number

1. Log in to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Navigate to Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active Numbers
3. Buy a new number (NYC 929 area code recommended) or use existing

3. Set **"A CALL COMES IN"** to:
   - **Webhook**: `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/voice/incoming`
   - **HTTP Method**: `POST`

### 3. Configure Media Streams

The `/voice/incoming` endpoint will automatically set up TwiML that redirects to WebSocket:

```xml
<Response>
  <Connect>
    <Stream url="wss://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/ws/twilio" />
  </Connect>
</Response>
```

### 4. Test the Integration

Call your Twilio number. You should hear:
- **English**: "Hello! Thank you for calling Bangkok Fortune. How may I help you today?"
- **Thai** (if detected): "‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞..."

## üîç Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs on Railway

# Using Railway CLI
railway logs

# Or view in Railway dashboard
```

```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/health
```

- Total calls
- Bookings made
- Estimated revenue
- No-shows

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Twilio Call Connects but No Audio

**Solution**: Check WebSocket endpoint is accessible:
```bash
wscat -c wss://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/ws/twilio
# Should connect without errors
```

### Issue: Square Booking Fails

**Solution**: 
1. Verify `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT` is set correctly (`sandbox` vs `production`)
2. Check location ID matches your Square account
3. Ensure services exist in Square dashboard

### Issue: Speech Not Detected

**Solution**:
1. Verify OpenAI Realtime API key has correct permissions
2. Check audio codec in Twilio settings (should be PCM Œº-law)
3. Review logs for STT errors

### Issue: Wrong Language Detected

**Solution**: The system auto-detects language from first utterance. Update prompts in `packages/brain/src/prompts/` if needed.
